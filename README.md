## 📑 Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical log for computer organization and architecture concepts. It covers the fundamental building blocks of modern computing systems.

## 🔬 Core Focus Areas
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Understanding how hardware interprets software commands.
- **CPU Logic:** Exploring ALU operations, control units, and datapath design.
- **Memory Hierarchy:** Analyzing cache, RAM, and storage interactions.

## 🎓 Background
Created during my tenure at **RJIT** to document the bridge between high-level code and low-level gate logic.
